            Hi! I'm Ethan! I worked for a few years as a barista in Newark, DE 
            before transitioning into a career as a computer hardware repair technician. 
            My goal is to bring my career path full circle, back to a cafe, 
            but instead of brewing the coffe I will be drinking it while brewing up HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript and other launguages that I learn along the way!
